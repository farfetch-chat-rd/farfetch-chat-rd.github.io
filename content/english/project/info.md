## Objectives 

[Farfetch Chat R&D](images/portfolio/farfetch_chat_rd_info.pdf) proposes to research and deliver a new generation of task-oriented conversational agents that
interact with users using verbal and visual information in a seamless manner. Through the conversation,
Farfetch Chat must provide targeted advice and "physical store-like" experience while maintaining user
engagement.

This entails the following key components:

- Disrupt the E-Commerce High-End Fashion Marketplace
- Foundations for a Communication, Education and Knowledge Network
- Scientific Breakthroughs on Multimodal Conversational AI Agents

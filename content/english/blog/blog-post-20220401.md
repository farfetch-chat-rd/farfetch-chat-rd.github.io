We've launched a [Conversational AI mailing list](https://www.freelists.org/list/conversational-ai) as part of our commitment to allow for more accessible communication on a crucial topic: Conversational AI Agents.

The lack of mailings that share, discuss, and brainstorm the development, business, and research problems when designing and implementing conversational agents has been identified as a massive gap.

The Conversational-AI mailing list serves as a hub for researchers, developers, product managers, and practitioners to exchange information about:
1) Debates, discussions, and the exchange of ideas
2) Notifications of forthcoming events, such as coding jams
3) Conversational AI Agents: Risks and Best Practices

Conversational AI experts will find this a helpful [list](https://www.freelists.org/list/conversational-ai). As a result, the goal is to speak up that are mostly, if not entirely, about Conversational Agents.

We're excited to start this communication channel by welcoming everyone to this email list. This list is expected to bring together professionals from various industries to share their experiences and brainstorm about the topic's triumphs and failures.

Let's get this conversation started.

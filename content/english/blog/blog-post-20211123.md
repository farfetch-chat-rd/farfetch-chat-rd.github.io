We are thrilled to announce that we will work with [VISUM 2022](https://visum.inesctec.pt/) on a new Mentorship Program initiative.

It will be an inspiring opportunity for young researchers to get feedback from senior scholars and industrial researchers in Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

We will announce more information as the VISUM organization evolves in preparing the details of this initiative. We can share, however, the following:

**Format**
1. Students will be able to define their preferences regarding mentors.
2. Ideally, mentors will meet with each student twice during the summer school (1 hour each).

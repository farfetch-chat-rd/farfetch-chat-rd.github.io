iFetch team is a multidisciplinary project that aims to research conversational technology and algorithms that will impact FARFETCH high-end fashion business.

After 15 months of research and development, we are thrilled to accomplish pivotal milestones aligned with our ambitions.

- We are thrilled to have a common code-base shared amongst all partners of the project that accelerates research and development in multimodal conversational agents;
- As part of this code-base, we have the functional working blocks laid out for the foundations in terms of specifications and software platform;
- A common multimodal dataset grounded on FARFETCH product catalogue in line with our tone of voice;
- A conversational AI agent that can encode user utterances into an internal representation required to  decode internal states to the agent’s actions and  responses for given business cases;

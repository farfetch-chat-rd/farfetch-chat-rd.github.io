Earlier this month, we have announced the collaboration with VISUM Summer School in a new Mentorship Program initiative (see [our post here](https://ifetch-chatbot.github.io/blog/blog-post-20220106/)).

Today we bring you more updates on this initiative.

We are preparing a mentoring programme on Conversational AI Agents. We will challenge our mentee to work with the mentor on a computer vision problem while getting acquainted with the latest developments in conversational agents.

The elected participant to our programme will have the possibility to have conversations with our mentor, Ricardo Sousa ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rjgsousa/)/[Twitter](https://twitter.com/rjgsousa)), during VISUM summer school week. In addition, we will organize at least two sessions to discuss the progress of the mentoring programme.

If you are interested in conversational agents and willing to learn more about what we are doing at [iFetch](https://ifetch-chatbot.github.io/), take the chance in participating in [VISUM 2022, their 10th edition](https://visum.inesctec.pt/)!

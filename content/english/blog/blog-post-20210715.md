On the 28th of June at Centro de Congressos Lisbon, FARFETCH  participated in "The contribution of the CMU Portugal international partnership for the high-tech Unicorn ecosystem in Portugal" within the "Encontro CiÃªncia 2021" event.

Luis Carvalho, SVP of Technology, one of our project members, took part in the discussion panel to address the relevance of the FARFETCH relationship with the CMU Portugal programme and its pivotal role in universities and their research institutes.

Following this event, CMU Portugal prepared a video about our project, which you can check on its youtube channel and included below.
